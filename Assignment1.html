        <h3>Importance of CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS has various importance. Some of these importance are as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>CSS saves time</b> <br>
                You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for
                each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Easy maintenance</b> <br>
                To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated
                automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Global web standardse</b> <br>
                Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it's a good idea to
                start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Platform Independence</b> <br>
                The Script offer consistent platform independence and can support latest browsers as well.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- NB: Use your heading tags for headings and paragraph tags for the paragraphs. Also format the write-ups with paddings, margins, and borders to beautify them.
The entire write-up should have a background color “white” and it should be in three sections

The first section: Write the heading “First section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain your name and your love for technology. The text color should be green. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px.

The second section: Write the heading “Second section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain what you have learned so far and how css is important. The text color should be red. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px

The third section: Write the heading “Third section” and comment it out (use 18px). Explaining the difference between paddings, margins, and borders. The text color should be blue. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px. -->
